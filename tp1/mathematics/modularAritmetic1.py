# This problem is different from normal modular process because it involves modular congruence. 
#If you haven’t noticed, the two equations given contain ≡ instead of the normal =≡ denotes modular congruence and one of its properties 
#iif a␑ ≡ b mod n, then b ≡ a mod n. Moreover, congruence means that a and b has the same equivalence class.
